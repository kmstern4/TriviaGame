# TriviaGame

### About
This game was built as an assignment for the bootcamp I attended. Once the game starts, it will rotate through 10 questions, giving you 30 seconds to answer each question. If you answer a questions correctly, "Correct!" is displayed with a relevant image. If you answer a question incorrectly, the correct answer is shown along with a relevant image. Once you have made it through all the questions, the number of questions you answered correctly is displayed along with an image. There will be an option to restart the quiz. All of this is created dynamically from JavaScript on one html page.
